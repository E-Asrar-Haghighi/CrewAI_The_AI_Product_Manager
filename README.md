# CrewAI_The_AI_Product_Manager

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **multi-agent AI system** using the **CrewAI library** to analyze an image of a **B2B digital menu startup**. The system consists of four AI agents, each performing a specific role:

1. **🖼️ Image Description Agent** - Provides a detailed description of the image.
2. **🔍 UX Critique Agent** - Critically analyzes the image for UX flaws.
3. **🎨 UX Suggestion Agent** - Suggests improvements to enhance UX.
4. **📌 AI Product Manager** - Transforms UX suggestions into actionable user stories.

By leveraging **LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo) and CrewAI**, these agents work **sequentially** to improve digital menu designs effectively.
